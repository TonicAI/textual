Redact raw text
---------------
To redact sensitive information from a text string, pass the string to the `redact` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer

    textual = TextualNer()

    raw_redaction = textual.redact("My name is John, and today I am demoing Textual, a software product created by Tonic")
    print(raw_redaction.describe())

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    My name is [NAME_GIVEN_HI1h7], and [DATE_TIME_4hKfrH] I am demoing Textual, a software product created by [ORGANIZATION_P5XLAH]
    {
        "start": 11,
        "end": 15,
        "new_start": 11,
        "new_end": 29,
        "label": "NAME_GIVEN",
        "text": "John",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[NAME_GIVEN_HI1h7]"
    }
    {
        "start": 21,
        "end": 26,
        "new_start": 35,
        "new_end": 53,
        "label": "DATE_TIME",
        "text": "today",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[DATE_TIME_4hKfrH]"
    }
    {
        "start": 79,
        "end": 84,
        "new_start": 106,
        "new_end": 127,
        "label": "ORGANIZATION",
        "text": "Tonic",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[ORGANIZATION_P5XLAH]"
    }

You can also record `redact` calls, so that you can view and analyze results in the Textual application. To learn more, read :ref:`record-api-call-section`

Bulk redact raw text
---------------------
In the same way that you use the `redact` method to redact strings, you can use the `redact_bulk` method to redact many strings at the same time.

Each string is redacted individually. Each string is fed into our model independently and cannot affect other strings.

To redact sensitive information from a list of text strings, pass the list to the `redact_bulk` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer

    textual = TextualNer()

    raw_redaction = textual.redact_bulk(["Tonic was founded in 2018", "John Smith is a person"])
    print(raw_redaction.describe())

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    [ORGANIZATION_5Ve7OH] was founded in [DATE_TIME_DnuC1]
    {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 5,
        "new_start": 0,
        "new_end": 21,
        "label": "ORGANIZATION",
        "text": "Tonic",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[ORGANIZATION_5Ve7OH]"
    }
    {
        "start": 21,
        "end": 25,
        "new_start": 37,
        "new_end": 54,
        "label": "DATE_TIME",
        "text": "2018",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[DATE_TIME_DnuC1]"
    }
    [NAME_GIVEN_dySb5] [NAME_FAMILY_7w4Db3] is a person
    {
        "start": 0,
        "end": 4,
        "new_start": 0,
        "new_end": 18,
        "label": "NAME_GIVEN",
        "text": "John",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[NAME_GIVEN_dySb5]"
    }
    {
        "start": 5,
        "end": 10,
        "new_start": 19,
        "new_end": 39,
        "label": "NAME_FAMILY",
        "text": "Smith",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "[NAME_FAMILY_7w4Db3]"
    }

Redact JSON data
----------------
To redact sensitive information from a JSON string or Python dict, pass the object to the `redact_json` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer
    import json

    textual = TextualNer()

    d=dict()
    d['person']={'first':'John','last':'OReilly'}
    d['address']={'city': 'Memphis', 'state':'TN', 'street': '847 Rocky Top', 'zip':1234}
    d['description'] = 'John is a man that lives in Memphis.  He is 37 years old and is married to Cynthia'

    json_redaction = textual.redact_json(d, {"LOCATION_ZIP":"Synthesis"})

    print(json.dumps(json.loads(json_redaction.redacted_text), indent=2))

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    {
    "person": {
        "first": "[NAME_GIVEN_WpFV4]",
        "last": "[NAME_FAMILY_orTxwj3I]"
    },
    "address": {
        "city": "[LOCATION_CITY_UtpIl2tL]",
        "state": "[LOCATION_STATE_n24]",
        "street": "[LOCATION_ADDRESS_KwZ3MdDLSrzNhwB]",
        "zip": 0
    },
    "description": "[NAME_GIVEN_WpFV4] is a man that lives in [LOCATION_CITY_UtpIl2tL].  He is [DATE_TIME_LLr6L3gpNcOcl3] and is married to [NAME_GIVEN_yWfthDa6]"
    }

Redact XML data
----------------
To redact sensitive information from XML, pass the XML document string to the `redact_xml` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer
    import json

    textual = TextualNer()

    xml_string = '''<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!-- This XML document contains sample PII with namespaces and attributes -->
    <PersonInfo xmlns="http://www.example.com/default" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:contact="http://www.example.com/contact">
        <!-- Personal Information with an attribute containing PII -->
        <Name preferred="true" contact:userID="john.doe123">
            <FirstName>John</FirstName>
            <LastName>Doe</LastName>He was born in 1980.</Name>

        <contact:Details>
            <!-- Email stored in an attribute for demonstration -->
            <contact:Email address="john.doe@example.com"/>
            <contact:Phone type="mobile" number="555-6789"/>
        </contact:Details>

        <!-- SSN stored as an attribute -->
        <SSN value="987-65-4321" xsi:nil="false"/>
        <data>his name was John Doe</data>
    </PersonInfo>'''

    xml_redaction = textual.redact_xml(xml_string)

The response includes entity level information, including the XPATH at which the sensitive entity is found. The start and end positions are relative to the beginning of thhe XPATH location where the entity is found.

Redact HTML data
----------------
To redact sensitive information from HTML, pass the HTML document string to the `redact_html` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer
    import json

    textual = TextualNer()

    html_content = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>John Doe</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>John Doe</h1>
            <p>John Doe is a person who lives in New York City.</p>
            <p>John Doe's phone number is 555-555-5555.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
    """

    xml_redaction = textual.redact_html(html_content)

The response includes entity level information, including the XPATH at which the sensitive entity is found. The start and end positions are relative to the beginning of thhe XPATH location where the entity is found.

Choosing tokenization or synthesis  raw text
----------------------------------------------
You can choose whether to synthesize or tokenize a given entity. By default, all entities are tokenized.

To specify the entities to synthesize or tokenize, use the `generator_config` parameter. This works the same way for all of the `redact` functions.

The following example passes a string to the `redact` method, but sets some entities to `Synthesis`, which indicates to use realistic replacement values:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer

    textual = TextualNer()
    generator_config = {"NAME_GIVEN":"Synthesis", "ORGANIZATION":"Synthesis"}
    raw_synthesis = textual.redact(
        "My name is John, and today I am demoing Textual, a software product created by Tonic", 
        generator_config=generator_config)
    print(raw_synthesis.describe())

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    My name is Alfonzo, and today I am demoing Textual, a software product created by New Ignition Worldwide
    {
        "start": 11,
        "end": 15,
        "new_start": 11,
        "new_end": 18,
        "label": "NAME_GIVEN",
        "text": "John",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "Alfonzo"
    }
    {
        "start": 79,
        "end": 84,
        "new_start": 82,
        "new_end": 104,
        "label": "ORGANIZATION",
        "text": "Tonic",
        "score": 0.9,
        "language": "en",
        "new_text": "New Ignition Worldwide"
    }          

Using LLM synthesis
-------------------
The following example passes the string to the `llm_synthesis` method:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer

    textual = TextualNer()

    raw_synthesis = textual.llm_synthesis("My name is John, and today I am demoing Textual, a software product created by Tonic")
    print(raw_synthesis.describe())

This produces the following output:

.. code-block:: console

    My name is Matthew, and today I am demoing Textual, a software product created by Google.
    {
        "start": 11,
        "end": 15,
        "label": "NAME_GIVEN",
        "text": "John",
        "score": 0.9
    }
    {
        "start": 79,
        "end": 84,
        "label": "ORGANIZATION",
        "text": "Tonic",
        "score": 0.9
    }

Note that LLM Synthesis is non-deterministic â€” you will likely get different results each time you run it.

Recording API requests
----------------------
When you use the :meth:`redact<tonic_textual.redact_api.TextualNer.redact>` method to redact text, you can optionally record these requests to view and analyze later in the Textual application. The `redact` method takes an optional `record_options` (:class:`RecordApiRequestOptions<tonic_textual.classes.record_api_request_options.RecordApiRequestOptions>`) argument. To record an API request:

.. code-block:: python

    from tonic_textual.redact_api import TextualNer
    from tonic_textual.classes.record_api_request_options import RecordApiRequestOptions

    ner = TextualNer()

    ner.redact("My name is John Doe", record_options=RecordApiRequestOptions(
        record=True,
        retention_time_in_hours=1,
        tags=["my_first_request"])
    )

The above code runs the redaction in the same way as any other redaction request, and then records the API request and its results. The request itself is automatically purged after 1 hour.  You can view the results from the **API Explorer** page in Textual.  The retention time is specified in hours and can be set to a value between 1 and 720.
